Here are the steps to execute Automation Scripts:

1) Clone project into you are local repository

git clone https://github.com/JeevanMaru/Selenium-Java-Docker.git

2)wait for to download all dependencies from pom.xml

3)update Maven project to clear the errors

4)Framework has implemented with POM pattern.

5) Execute scripts by using TestNG Test

6) Execute scripts by using TestNG Suite if you want to see the results.

7) Run as Maven build to execute test cases through Maven.

Note: 1)currently I have not implemented any reports but you can see testng reports.

Issue: Currently all driver instances are not closed automatically I am working on it..

Except this issue all the test cases and assertion are implemented..
